    "### Overview of the project\n",
    "The goal of this project is to design and develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent capable of autonomous driving within the HighwayEnv simulation environment. Autonomous driving presents a significant challenge in artificial intelligence and machine learning, requiring agents to make decisions that balance safety, efficiency, and adaptability in real-time. Using the tools provided by the Stable Baselines 3 library, this project aims to train and evaluate DRL algorithms to optimize the driving behavior of the agent.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "This project encompasses three primary objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reward Engineering:** Design and implement a custom reward function that encourages optimal\n",
    "driving behavior.\n",
    "- **Algorithm Comparison:** Train your agent using at least two different DRL algorithms from Stable\n",
    "Baselines 3 and compare their performances.\n",
    "- **Environment Extension:** Modify the environment to increase its complexity and adapt your agent\n",
    "accordingly."

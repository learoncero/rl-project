    "This notebook explores the impact of using a continuous action space on the performance of an agent on our predefined performance metrics (percent of steps where a collision occurred, the vehicle accelerated too much, and kept a safe distance from other vehicles, and overtook vehicles to the left. We will evaluate the performance of models trained on the default reward function and our custom function, using the SAC and TD3 algorithms. \n",

    "While metrics like 0 collisions for each agent may seem promising, inspecting the animations of these agents shows that none of them are learning to drive smoothly. Their behavior is erratic, and in every episode, they seemed to run off the road, or spin around, while the other cars in the simulation drove forward and left the ego vehicles behind (explaining the perfect scores for no left cars being overtaken).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that the agents perform poorly because the continuous action space is much larger than the discrete meta action space (which allowed the agent to choose from 1 of 5 actions). Therefore, future experiments could allow the agents to train for longer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the reward function should be adjusted to this action space, perhaps so that collisions and overtaking a left vehicle is not so heavily penalized, encouraging forward driving (instead of spinning to avoid potentially colliding or overtaking a left car). "

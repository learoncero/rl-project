    "## Summary of the default reward function in `highway-fast-v0`\n",
    "\n",
    "The default reward function in the highway-fast-v0 environment is designed to promote safe and efficient driving behaviors. It calculates a scalar reward for each action based on four key factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collision Penalty:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `collision_reward` penalizes the agent if the vehicle crashes. This is a binary penalty, either 0 (no crash) or a negative value (collision occurred).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Right Lane Reward:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `right_lane_reward` rewards the agent for staying in the rightmost lane. The reward increases as the vehicle moves closer to the rightmost lane, encouraging proper lane usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **High-Speed Reward:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `high_speed_reward` incentivizes driving at higher speeds. The reward is proportional to the vehicle's forward speed, normalized within a defined speed range.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **On-Road Reward:**\n",
    "   - The `on_road_reward` encourages the vehicle to stay on the road by multiplying the total reward by 1 if the vehicle is on the road or 0 if it is off-road. This means that if the vehicle is off-road, the total reward is also zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shortcomings of the default reward function in `highway-fast-v0`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overemphasising the rightmost lane:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `right_lane_reward` encourages staying in the rightmost lane, which may not be in line with realistic driving goals. For example, overtaking may require swerving into other lanes, which is not directly encouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Speed reward out of context:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `high_speed_reward` rewards speed linearly, but does not take into account traffic density. Speeding in traffic jams should be penalised.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Binary Collision Penalty:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `collision_reward` is binary, providing the same penalty regardless of the severity or cause of the crash. This ignores scenarios like near-misses, which could be penalized slightly to encourage caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lack of a safe distance mechanism:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The current reward function does not provide an incentive to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front. However, promoting a safe following distance is a fundamental part of safe driving. It helps avoid collisions and creates smoother traffic flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Overtaking cars directly to the left:**\n",
    "   - The current reward function does not penalize actions overtaking cars directly to the rider's left, which is illegal in most EU countries. The highway environment does not penalize overtaking cars to the left of the ego vehicle, and therefore would violate Belgium's highway code. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Not prioritizing rider's comfort:**\n",
    "   - The current reward function does not penalize actions that would hurt the rider's user experience, for example, increasing or decreasing speed too quickly, which would jolt the rider. Acceleration of +/- 2 meters per second per second is the threshold after which drivers begin to experience discomfort.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Add safe distance reward\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the Front Vehicle:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Use the existing `road.neighbour_vehicles(vehicle)` method to locate the vehicle ahead of the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compute the Distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Calculate the distance between the agent's vehicle and the identified front vehicle. If no front vehicle exists, assume the distance is infinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define the Reward:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Reward the agent if the distance exceeds a safe threshold (e.g., 10 meters). Penalize the agent as the distance decreases below this threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encourages the agent to maintain a safe distance, reducing the likelihood of rear-end collisions.\n",
    "- Promotes safer and more realistic driving behaviors."

    "    - Increment the count of nearby vehicles if they are within the defined traffic radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compute Traffic Density Factor:\n",
    "    - Use the number of nearby vehicles to calculate a traffic density factor, where higher traffic density reduces the reward.\n",
    "    - Define a maximum density (max_density, e.g., 10 vehicles) for scaling. The factor decreases linearly as the density approaches this maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scale the High-Speed Reward:\n",
    "    - Adjust the agent's speed-based reward (scaled_speed) using the traffic density factor.\n",
    "    - Clip the reward within a range of 0 to 1 for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "- Encourages the agent to drive at higher speeds when traffic density is low, promoting efficient driving.\n",

In the evaluation of the agent trained on our custom reward function, a collision occurs in only 6 percent of recorded steps, while a collision occurs in roughly 12 percent of all recorded steps in the agent trained on the default reward function. This improvement is likely due to the heavier negative weight we apply to collisions (-4), compared to the weight -1 used by the default reward function.\n",

The agent trained on the custom reward function stayed out of the leftmost lane in roughly 77 percent of all recorded steps, while the default agent stayed out of the leftmost lane in roughly 71% of all recorded steps. It is likely that this decrease in left lane usage is due to the higher reward weight we place on right lane usage (0.4 in the custom environment, compared to 0.1 in the default environment).  \n",

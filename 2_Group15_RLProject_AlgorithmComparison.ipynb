The algorithms being compared are DQN, PPO, A2C, and TRPO. Each algorithm will be trained using the same environment configuration to guarantee a fair comparison.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collisions\n",
    "PPO and TRPO excel in avoid collisions very well, likely due to their ability to balance exploration and exploitation effectively and prioritize safety-related policies. A2C’s aggressive behavior and less stable updates lead to riskier actions and more collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Right lane usage\n",
    "PPO and TRPO emphasize stable policy updates, encouraging balanced behavior and leading to strong but not absolute right-lane adherence - both models allowed the ego vehicle to use the leftmost lane in at least 30% of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "A2C's 100% avoidance of the leftmost lane suggests that its optimization overly prioritized the \"right lane reward.\" This might indicate that the policy fixated on staying in the right lane as a dominant strategy, potentially neglecting other objectives like overtaking or lane changes for safety or efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### On road \n",
    "All agents stayed on the road in 100% of recorded steps. The DiscreteMetaAction space does not appear to allow vehicles the option of running off the road, unlike the ContinuousActionSpace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safe distance from other vehicles \n",
    "\n",
    "TRPO and PPO are strong here due to their focus on stable policy optimization. A2C's tendency to oscillate between strategies might result in closer, riskier behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not overtaking vehicles to the left \n",
    "A2C's high overtaking rate may be due to its relatively fewer updates (compared to PPO and TRPO), which is penalized in this scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Driver comfort performance comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comfortable acceleration\n",
    "PPO and TRPO excel due to their optimization constraints, which discourage extreme changes in behavior. A2C’s less stable updates might result in jerky driving."

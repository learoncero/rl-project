    "## 0. Notebook description\n",
    "This notebook explores the impact of increased environment complexity on the agent's performance. We modify key environment parameters, such as the `vehicles_count` and `lanes_count`, to introduce greater challenges (e.g., denser traffic, more lanes). \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is structured as follows:\n",
    "1. **Environment Modification:** Adjusts environment parameters to create a more complex scenario.\n",
    "2. **Agent Testing:** Evaluates a pre-trained agent's performance in the modified environment.\n",
    "3. **Retraining:** Trains an agent from scratch to adapt to the new complexity.\n",
    "4. **Performance Analysis:** Compares the pre-trained agent's performance with the retrained agent, discussing insights and observed trends."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The pre-trained agent, originally trained on a simpler environment (4 lanes and 50 vehicles), demonstrated surprisingly good performance in the more complex environment (6 lanes and 80 vehicles). This can be attributed to the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Generalization Capability:**\\\n",
    "The pre-trained agent may have learned strategies that are robust and adaptable in different scenarios. For example, strategies such as maintaining safe distances, staying in the correct lane or avoiding collisions are effective regardless of the number of lanes or vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Reward Structure:**\\\n",
    "Since the reward structure in the complex environment is the same as the one used during training in the simpler environment, the agent's learned behavior can remain optimal.  For example, rewards for “staying in the right lane” or “keeping a safe distance” are likely to incentivize behaviors that are beneficial in both environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Complexity Dilution:**\\\n",
    "In environments with higher vehicle density, the traffic flow may stabilize due to increased congestion, making it easier for the agent to avoid abrupt maneuvers or collisions. This phenomenon can make the environment seem less unpredictable than initially expected."

    "The agent trained on the complex environment showed only marginal improvements compared to the pre-trained agent on the less complex environment. This can be explained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Complexity of the environment:**\\\n",
    "The complex environment introduces more variables (e.g., more lanes and vehicles), increasing the difficulty of identifying and exploiting specific patterns during training. As a result, learning can be slower and may not significantly outperform the pre-trained agent within the given training duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Trade-off Between Generalization and Specialization:**\\\n",
    "The newly trained agent might adapt too much to the complexity of the new environment, e.g. higher vehicle density or number of lanes, which could lead to slightly less efficient behavior in scenarios that overlap with the simpler environment."

    "- Retraining agents on more complex environments does not always guarantee significant performance gains, particularly when the reward structures and overarching strategies remain consistent.\n",
